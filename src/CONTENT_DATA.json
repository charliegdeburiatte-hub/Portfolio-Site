    "short": "IT Support Specialist with 1.5 years experience in technical troubleshooting and systems administration. Building expertise through hands-on projects and continuous learning.",

    "medium": "I'm building my career in IT by learning systems deeply and applying that knowledge through real projects. From home lab experimentation to AI-powered tools, I focus on understanding not just how things work, but why they work. My goal is to grow into roles where I can solve real technical problems and keep evolving.",

    "full": "I became genuinely interested in technology in my early teens, starting as a typical user before gradually becoming the person who fixed things. Gaming, building PCs, and experimenting with virtual machines sparked a deeper curiosity about how systems actually work beneath the surface. Over time, that curiosity shifted from using technology to understanding and building it.\n\nAlthough I originally considered paths like healthcare or history, I found myself increasingly drawn to systems, infrastructure, and problem-solving. Building my own environments and troubleshooting real hardware issues, including diagnosing instability linked to Intel's 13th generation platform, strengthened my interest in technical problem-solving and persistence.\n\nMore recently, the rapid evolution of AI reignited that same curiosity. What began as casual experimentation evolved into using AI tools to build practical projects and improve workflows. Today, I'm focused on developing strong IT fundamentals while continuing to explore how modern tools, including AI, can enhance real-world systems and operations.",

    "what_drives_me": "I'm driven by understanding how systems work and improving them over time. I enjoy solving technical problems, especially when the solution isn't immediately obvious. Contributing to the smooth operation of technology, even behind the scenes, is something I find genuinely rewarding.",

Built with privacy as a priority — all processing happens in your browser with no data sent to servers. The intelligent weighted scoring algorithm treats required skills as 3x more important than preferred skills (reflecting real hiring priorities) and adds experience bonuses up to 20 points.\n\nOriginally developed as a Firefox browser extension, the project pivoted to a web application in v2.0 for universal access and better user experience. Since then it has grown into a full job search toolkit: an application tracker with pipeline stages, a recurring skill gap analyser, shareable results links, a PWA for mobile install, and a bookmarklet for one-click analysis from any job listing.",
